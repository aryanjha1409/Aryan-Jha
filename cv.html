<caption>Extra Activities</caption><hr>
<pr>During my time at college, I actively engaged in a variety of extracurricular activities that enriched my academic experience and helped me develop valuable skills. I served as the president of the Environmental Club, where I organized campus clean-up events and sustainability workshops, fostering a greater awareness of environmental issues among my peers. Additionally, I volunteered with the local food bank, coordinating food drives and helping to distribute meals to families in need. I also participated in intramural soccer, which not only kept me physically active but also allowed me to build strong friendships and improve my teamwork skills. These experiences not only enhanced my leadership and organizational abilities but also deepened my commitment to community service and personal growth.</pr>
